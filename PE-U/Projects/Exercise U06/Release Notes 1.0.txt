Game Project: 2D Random Exercise
Creator: Yuxuan Xia
Version: v1.0
Date: 11/9/2024

New Features
 - Created an animal prefab.
 - Created a Spawn Manager object for animal spawn management. It allows:
	- Spawning animals of random number.
	- Spawning animals of random color.
	- Spawning animals at random position conforming to Gaussian distribution.
	- Clean up all the spawned animals before next spawn.
 - Use a click button to trigger new spawn.

Fixes
 - No fixes yet.

Improvements
 - No improvements for previous features.

Known Issues
 - No known bugs.
 - The Button component's OnClick() event list cannot refer to the Spawn() function correctly if the SpawnManager class inherits from the Singleton class, so the inheritance is changed back to Monobehavior instead. The Singleton scripts are not used.
